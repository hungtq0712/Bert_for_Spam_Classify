the siam southwest regional mathematics in industry workshop . a time  span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an additional  ten minutes or so for discussion . the workshop , funded under the auspices  of a national science foundation grant to siam will not be a standard  applied mathematics event with representatives from industry , academe , and  governmental agencies presenting their latest research results . instead the  meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to  the projects of industry and governmental laboratories . additionally the  event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and  collaboration between the academy , industry , and government laboratories .  the workshop will be held at the university of houston hilton hotel , april  27 - 28 . funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the cost  of food and lodging of invited speakers . we will be happy to make travel  arrangements on this end if so desired .  we hope that you can accept our invitation . if this is the case please  furnish us with a title , a short abstract , and a list of the necessary  equipment
